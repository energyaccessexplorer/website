    Energy Access Explorer is an online, open-source, interactive platform that
    synthesizes and analyzes more than 20 geographic data sets on both energy
    supply and demand. It is a multi-criteria analysis tool that uses
    location-specific resource availability and infrastructure data to represent
    energy supply. It also incorporates demographic data and data on social and
    productive uses to visualize demand for energy services. Together, these
    supply and demand indicators enable more comprehensive energy
    planning. Spatial analysis tools, including multi-criteria analysis,
    overlays, filters and buffer zones, help users identify and prioritize areas
    where energy access can be expanded.

  <p>
    The tool incorporates remote sensing data as well as data from global,
    national, sub-national and census databases that are either publicly
    available or provided by international partners and local stakeholders.  It
    can host data available in various resolutions, scales and formats allowing
    for better or new datasets to be incorporated once available. The selection
    of data is based on a literature review and a survey WRI conducts on the
    importance of certain datasets in geospatial energy access planning. The
    list of essential data is reviewed by local stakeholders to ensure the
    platform is relevant and applicable in the local context.
