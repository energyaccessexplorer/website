      <p>
        It is the first time I have seen a tool that offers different selections of data layers in the energy
        space in Ethiopia. As part of the digitization strategy of the country, coupled with the government’s objective for universal electrification,
        EAE will really help us know who should go where to provide electricity.

      <p>
        There is a high cost-saving saving benefit to using a tool like EAE. The fact that one can sit at their desk and
        generate essential information on demand and target market supply is exciting. This is going to change the energy sector.

      Deputy Director, Energy Planning, Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority
      of Kenya
    </h4>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Energy Access Explorer will be critical for facilitating planners to access
        data on load centers, energy resource availability, infrastructure in a
        timely manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a platform that will link the stakeholders that generate data with
        the ones that use it. EAE is likely to become very critical when it comes to
        energy planning as it will take into account the spatial dimension of energy
        systems and will inform the other planning tools (demand forecasting, short
        term optimization and long term expansion) that are currently being used in
        Kenya.

    <h2>Sitra Mulepo</h2>
    <h4>Senior Engineer, Ministry of Health, Uganda</h4>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Energy Access Explorer is a tool that can help the Ministry of Health assess
        the best options for providing energy in healthcare facilities and make
        related decisions. It provides important initial information before moving
        towards the project planning and implementation phases.  And as such, it can
        reduce the time-intensive data collection and analysis efforts to identify
        the facilities and their needs. Once these are mapped out, there is no need
        to visit all facilities (but for some verification) and we (MoH) can assess
        the best way to provide energy either via solar systems or connecting to the
        grid.

        Energy Access Explorer is crucial for rolling out projects for rural
        electrification. At the Rural Energy Agency in Tanzania we are going to use
        it in planning to realize the cost and the opportunities for expanding
        energy access.  EAE will help REA move towards a more sophisticated way of

        With Energy Access Explorer, you don’t need a GIS software to overlay a
        number of layers, such as solar potential, population density, network data
        and carry out analysis. All you need is an Internet browser. Stakeholders in
        the energy sector should make use of the platform to make informed decisions
        in the sector.

      <p>
        Fascinated by the friendly architecture of the platform for visualizing
        spatial and statistical data. I was impressed by the possibility to
        combine supply and demand and to run different scenarios to get deep
        analysis to identify areas to electrify by priority order. Managing
        spatial data in a secure environment (in vector format or raster) was
        easy in the back end of the platform and doesn't really require deep
        knowledge in GIS. In Senegal, EAE will be useful for centralizing,
        visualizing and analyzing data in a free and open-source way.
