  <blockquote>
    <p>
      It is the first time I have seen a tool that offers different selections of data layers in the energy
      space in Ethiopia. As part of the digitization strategy of the country, coupled with the government’s objective for universal electrification,  
      EAE will really help us know who should go where to provide electricity.

  <h4>Ethiopia Solar Energy Development Association(ESEDA) Board Member and CEO for Green Scene Energy </h4>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There is a high cost-saving saving benefit to using a tool like EAE. The fact that one can sit at their desk and 
      generate essential information on demand and target market supply is exciting. This is going to change the energy sector.

  <h2>David Kariuki</h2>
  <h4>
    Deputy Director, Energy Planning, Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority
    of Kenya
  </h4>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Energy Access Explorer will be critical for facilitating planners to access
      data on load centers, energy resource availability, infrastructure in a
      timely manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a platform that will link the stakeholders that generate data with
      the ones that use it. EAE is likely to become very critical when it comes to
      energy planning as it will take into account the spatial dimension of energy
      systems and will inform the other planning tools (demand forecasting, short
      term optimization and long term expansion) that are currently being used in
      Kenya.

  <h2>Sitra Mulepo</h2>
  <h4>Senior Engineer, Ministry of Health, Uganda</h4>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Energy Access Explorer is a tool that can help the Ministry of Health assess
      the best options for providing energy in healthcare facilities and make
      related decisions. It provides important initial information before moving
      towards the project planning and implementation phases.  And as such, it can
      reduce the time-intensive data collection and analysis efforts to identify
      the facilities and their needs. Once these are mapped out, there is no need
      to visit all facilities (but for some verification) and we (MoH) can assess
      the best way to provide energy either via solar systems or connecting to the
      grid.

  <h2>Jonas Mwende</h2>
  <h4>GIS and IT Officer, Rural Energy Agency, Tanzania</h4>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Energy Access Explorer is crucial for rolling out projects for rural
      electrification. At the Rural Energy Agency in Tanzania we are going to use
      it in planning to realize the cost and the opportunities for expanding
      energy access.  EAE will help REA move towards a more sophisticated way of
      planning.

  <h2>Richard Muhangi</h2>
  <h4>GIS Lead, Rural Electrification Agency, Uganda</h4>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      With Energy Access Explorer, you don’t need a GIS software to overlay a
      number of layers, such as solar potential, population density, network data
      and carry out analysis. All you need is an Internet browser. Stakeholders in
      the energy sector should make use of the platform to make informed decisions
      in the sector.

      Energy Access Explorer provides a data-driven approach to expand energy access 
      through a simplified user interface which identifies market opportunities 
      for both public and private sectors.

  <h2>Veronica Mwiche</h2>
  <h4>Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Energy, Zambia</h4>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      EAE could not have been developed at a better time than this when the Zambian Government is 
      seeking to diversify the country’s energy mix and encourage the expansion of off-grid 
      renewable energy solutions to increase access to electricity.
