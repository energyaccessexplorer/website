  <h1>Sample Analysis</h1>

  <h3>
    Analyzing data on Energy Access Explorer reveals a number of findings
    important for energy and development gains.

  <h2>Better Quality Services</h2>

  <p>
    Expanding clean energy can improve healthcare and education in East Africa.
  </p>

  <p>
   East African countries face some of the world’s most significant development
   hurdles—including poverty, high maternal and child death rates, and low rates
   of literacy and education. Lack of a grid connection or unreliable power
   supplies are underlying contributors.
  </p>

  <p>
   Donors and development agencies need better and more granular data to ensure
   that their agricultural, health and education projects meet their full
   potential – which can’t happen when electricity access is not guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
   By demonstrating where there is high viable demand for electricity to power
   schools and health clinics, Energy Access Explorer enables donors and
   development finance institutions to determine where funding for
   electrification efforts can be most impactful.
  </p>

  <p>
   Data on Energy Access Explorer reveals that clean energy can help provide
   reliable power to vitally important facilities like schools and hospitals,
   which often lack stable electricity or rely on expensive back-up power
   systems like diesel generators.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>
     68% of the area housing Kenyan schools and healthcare facilities, and home
     to 81% of Kenya’s population, has strong hydropower potential. 82% of the
     area has strong solar power potential.
   </li>

   <li>
     69% of the area where Tanzanian schools and healthcare facilities are
     located – home to 71% of the nation’s population – has high potential for
     hydropower development. 98% of the area housing schools and hospitals has
     high solar potential.
   </li>

   <li>
     60% of the area where Ugandan schools and healthcare facilities are located
     (where 50% of the country’s population lives) too has high potential for
     small-scale hydropower. 93% of the area housing schools and hospitals has
     high solar potential.
   </li>
  </ul>

<section id="livelihood">
  <h2>Better Livelihoods</h2>

  <p>
    Renewable energy potential is high for many East African households without
    reliable electricity.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Kenya, nearly 70% of the total land area has high solar potential and a
    high percentage of people lacking reliable electricity. Approximately 4.3
    million people could benefit from this solar energy potential.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Tanzania, nearly 25% of the total land area has high potential for
    renewable energy (solar, wind and small hydropower) and a high percentage of
    people lacking electricity. Renewables could provide energy to approximately
    2.9 million people in these areas, about 6% of the total population.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Uganda, approximately 38% of total land area has high solar potential and
    a high percentage of people without reliable power.  Approximately 6.8
    million people could benefit from this solar energy potential.
  </p>

<section id="productivity">
  <h2>Higher Productivity</h2>

  <p>
    Renewable energy can boost East African economies and businesses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kenya’s economy is highly dependent on agriculture: 70% of the population
    earns all or part of their income from the agriculture industry. 20% of
    Kenya’s irrigated and rainfed croplands have high wind speeds. Wind turbines
    could also help power irrigation pumps and allow rainfed farms to use
    irrigation technologies, which can help farmers increase crop yields and
    become more resilient to changing rainfall patterns like droughts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Installing wind turbines in these areas to power agricultural production can
    improve electricity access without displacing agriculture.
